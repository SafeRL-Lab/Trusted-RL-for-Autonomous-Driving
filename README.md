# Trusted-RL-for-Autonomous-Driving








The repository is for Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, in which we investigate various safe RL baselines and safe RL benchmarks, including single agent RL and multi-agent RL. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact <gshangd[AT]foxmail.com>. (This repository is under actively development. We appreciate any constructive comments and suggestions)


You are more than welcome to update this list! If you find a paper about Safe RL which is not listed here, please

- fork this repository, add it and merge back;
- or report an issue here;
- or email <gshangd[AT]foxmail.com>.
