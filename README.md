# Trusted-RL-for-Autonomous-Driving



The repository is for Trusted Reinforcement Learning (RL) research and its application in autonomous driving, in which we investigate various trusted RL baselines and safe RL benchmarks, including single agent RL and multi-agent RL. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact <gshangd[AT]foxmail.com>. (This repository is under actively development. We appreciate any constructive comments and suggestions)


You are more than welcome to update this list! If you find a paper about Safe RL which is not listed here, please

- fork this repository, add it and merge back;
- or report an issue here;
